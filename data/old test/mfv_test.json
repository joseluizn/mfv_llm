Each situation is unique and depends on various factors, such as context, cultural norms, and personal beliefs. It's important to approach each situation with empathy, understanding, and a willingness to listen to different perspectives.\n\nInstead of focusing on what people should or shouldn't do, it's more productive to focus on promoting positive values and behaviors, such as empathy, kindness, respect, and fairness. By fostering a culture of understanding and empathy, we can create a more inclusive and compassionate society where everyone feels valued and respected.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that people have different perspectives and beliefs, and it's important to respect and acknowledge those differences. It's okay to disagree with someone's beliefs or actions, but it's important to do so in a respectful and constructive manner.\n\nIn summary, I don't think it's productive or fair to make blanket statements about what people should or shouldn't do.
